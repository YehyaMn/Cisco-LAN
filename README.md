**Introduction**
-----------------------

In this guide, we will walk through the process of configuring IP phone registration on a Cisco router using CLI. The setup involves configuring VLANs, DHCP server and scopes, telephony services, and IP phones, Trunk ports, Access ports, Sub-intefaces. It also includes troubleshooting common issues such as phones being stuck at "Configuring CM List" or "Configuring IP".

**Prerequisites**
------------------------------------
Before starting, ensure that you have the following:

Cisco Packet Tracer (version 7.x or higher) make sure to use firewall to block unnecessary sign in and interruptions(Anonymous study)
Basic understanding of networking (VLANs, IP addressing, DHCP, etc.)
A Cisco router and IP Phones added to the Packet Tracer workspace
A DHCP server (or router configured as DHCP) to assign IP addresses

**Step-by-Step Configuration**
------------------------------------------
Step 1: Setting Up VLANs on Switch0

I did the VLANs as follows:

Router(config)# vlan 100
Router(config-vlan)# name VOIP

Router(config)# vlan 2
Router(config-vlan)# name Servers

Router(config)# vlan 3
Router(config-vlan)# name Sales

Router(config)# vlan 4
Router(config-vlan)# name IT

Router(config)# vlan 100
Router(config-vlan)# name Voice

interface FastEthernet0/1
 switchport mode trunk
!
interface FastEthernet0/2
 switchport access vlan 4
 switchport mode access
 switchport voice vlan 100
!
interface FastEthernet0/3
 switchport access vlan 4
 switchport mode access
!


Open the router and configure the Voice VLAN (VLAN 100).
Make sure that the VLANs are configured on both the router and the switchs


Configure the switch ports where the phones will be connected to ensure they are in the correct access VLAN and voice VLAN.
Example on the switch:


Switch(config)# interface range fa0/1 - 2   # Adjust according to your ports
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 4  # Data VLAN for IT team, adjust according to your network
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport voice vlan 100

You can create a miscellaneous VLAN for security reasons, and assign range of unused ports, then shut them down

**Step 2: Configure DHCP for Voice VLAN**
-------------------------------------------------------
Configure DHCP Server:

Set up a DHCP pool for the Voice VLAN with a TFTP server address pointing to the router's IP 172.16.0.1/16.

**Step 3: Configure Telephony Service on the Router**
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Enable Telephony Service:

On the router, configure the telephony service and specify the max ephones and max directory numbers.

Example on the Telephony router:

Router(config)# telephony-service
Router(config-telephony)# max-ephones 2
Router(config-telephony)# max-dn 2
Router(config-telephony)# ip source-address 172.16.0.1  # Router's IP in the Voice VLAN

**Telephony Configuration:**
---------------------------------

Assign Extensions:

To assign extensions to IP phones (called ephones) and map them to a MAC address on a Cisco router, you will use the telephony-service configuration in Packet Tracer. Router 2811 has this feature

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide for assigning extensions to IP phones and associating them with MAC addresses.

Steps for Assigning Extensions to IP Phones (ephones)

Router(config-telephony)# ephone 1
Router(config-ephone)# mac-address xxxx.xxxx.xxxx  # Replace with the MAC address of the first IP phone
Router(config-ephone)# button 1:1 # Assign extension 1000 to the first phone

Router(config-telephony)# ephone 2
Router(config-ephone)# mac-address xxxx.xxxx.xxxx  # Replace with the MAC address of the second IP phone
Router(config-ephone)# button 1:2





Remove the Phone from the Network:

In Packet Tracer, simply remove the IP phone from the workspace and reconnect it.
This will reset the phone and cause it to request a new IP address.
Unregister Using CLI (Real Cisco Devices):

On real devices, you can use the following command to unregister a phone from the router:

Router(config)# no ephone 1   # Replace '1' with the phone's ephone number
Additional Notes
Packet Tracer may have limitations on telephony services and might not support all the commands and features available in a real Cisco environment.
Make sure VLANs are correctly configured across all devices in the network to ensure proper communication between the router and IP phones.
